# TensorFlow Docker Images

This directory contains examples of MultiWorkerMirrored Training along with the docker file to build them

- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) contains all dependenices required to build a container image using docker with the training examples
- [Dockerfile.gpu](Dockerfile.gpu) contains all dependenices required to build a container image using docker with gpu and the tensorflow model garden
- [keras_mnist.py](mnist.py) demonstrates how to train an MNIST classifier using
  [tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy and Keras Tensorflow 2.0 API](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).
- [custom_training_mnist.py](mnist.py) demonstrates how to train a fashion MNIST classifier using
  [tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy and Tensorflow 2.0 Custom Training Loop APIs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/custom_training).
- [keras_resnet_cifar.py](keras_resnet_cifar.py) demonstrates how to train the resnet56 model on the Cifar-10 dataset using
  [tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy and Keras Tensorflow 2.0 API](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).
## Best Practices

- Always pin the TensorFlow version with the Docker image tag. This ensures that
  TensorFlow updates don't adversely impact your training program for future
  runs.
- When creating an image, specify version tags (see below). If you make code
  changes, increment the version. Cluster managers will not pull an updated
  Docker image if they have them cached. Also, versions ensure that you have
  a single copy of the code running for each job.

## Building the Docker Files

Ensure that docker is installed on your system.

First, pick an image name for the job. When running on a cluster manager, you
will want to push your images to a container registry. Note that both the
[Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/)
and the [Amazon EC2 Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) require
special paths. We append `:v1` to version our images. Versioning images is
strongly recommended for reasons described in the best practices section.

```sh
docker build -t <image_name>:v1 -f Dockerfile .
# Use gcloud docker push instead if on Google Container Registry.
docker push <image_name>:v1
```

If you make any updates to the code, increment the version and rerun the above
commands with the new version.

## Running the keras_mnist.py example

The [keras_mnist.py](keras_mnist.py) example demonstrates how to train an MNIST classifier using
[tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy and Keras Tensorflow 2.0 API](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).
The final model is saved to disk by the chief worker process. The disk is assumed to be mounted onto the running container by the cluster manager.
It assumes that the cluster configuration is passed in through the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable when deployed in the cluster

## Running the custom_training_mnist.py example

The [custom_training_mnist.py](mnist.py) example demonstrates how to train a fashion MNIST classifier using
[tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy and Tensorflow 2.0 Custom Training Loop APIs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/custom_training).
The final model is saved to disk by the chief worker process. The disk is assumed to be mounted onto the running container by the cluster manager.
It assumes that the cluster configuration is passed in through the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable when deployed in the cluster.

## Running the keras_resnet_cifar.py example

The [keras_resnet_cifar.py](keras_resnet_cifar.py) example demonstrates how to train a Resnet56 model on the cifar-10 dataset using
[tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy and Keras Tensorflow 2.0 API](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).
The final model is saved to the GCP storage bucket.
It assumes that the cluster configuration is passed in through the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable when deployed in the cluster.
